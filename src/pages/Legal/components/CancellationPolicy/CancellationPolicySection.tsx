        <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Lessons canceled at least 24 hours before the scheduled start time are eligible for a full refund or credit
          toward a future lesson. Cancellations made within 24 hours of the scheduled lesson are non-refundable and not
          eligible for credit, except in the case of documented emergencies and only at the sole discretion of Conner
          Pohl Instruction. Failure to attend a scheduled lesson without notice will be considered a no-show, and the
          lesson will be forfeited without refund or credit.

        <h3>Instructor Cancellations</h3>
        <p>
          If your booked instructor must cancel a lesson, you will be offered either a full refund or a credit toward a
          future lesson. Conner Pohl Instruction will make reasonable efforts to notify clients as soon as possible in
          the event of instructor unavailability.

        <h3>Rescheduling</h3>
        <p>
          Rescheduling requests made with less than 24 hoursâ€™ notice are not guaranteed and will be considered on a
          case-by-case basis, depending on instructor and facility availability. If rescheduling cannot be accommodated,
          the cancellation terms outlined above will apply.

        <h3>Late Arrivals</h3>
        <p>
          Clients arriving late to a scheduled lesson are responsible only for the remaining time in the lesson. Lessons
          will not be extended beyond the originally scheduled end time. If a client arrives more than fifteen (15)
          minutes late without notice, the lesson may be deemed a no-show and forfeited without refund.
